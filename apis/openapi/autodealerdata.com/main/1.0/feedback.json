Please provide only the URL, and only the URL, as a string. \nNEVER return example URLs like example.com, localhost, or 123.com. If unsure, simply fail the request.\nIf an API already has a partial server URL that partial server URL should be used. Eg. /rest should be https://api.example.com/rest. \n",

Since this appears to be the actual production API URL referenced in the official spec, I'm confident returning it.",
