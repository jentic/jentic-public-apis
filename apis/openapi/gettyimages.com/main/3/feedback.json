The source URL is given in x-jentic-source-url as \"https://api.gettyimages.com/swagger/v3/swagger.json\"\n2. Getty Images is a well-known company with a documented API\n3. The version is specified as \"3\" in the API info\n4. This follows the standard pattern of their API structure\n\nThe base URL removes the \"swagger\" path component but keeps the version (/v3) since that's the API version being accessed.",
