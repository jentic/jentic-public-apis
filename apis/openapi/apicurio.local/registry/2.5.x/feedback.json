Please provide only the URL, and only the URL, as a string. \nNEVER return example URLs like example.com, localhost, or 123.com.

The API description explicitly states \"The Apicurio Registry REST API is available from `https://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2` by default\"\n2. This matches with the note that \"you must prefix all API operation paths with `../apis/registry/v2`\"\n3. This is not an example URL but rather a placeholder URL pattern that users would replace with their actual registry URL",
