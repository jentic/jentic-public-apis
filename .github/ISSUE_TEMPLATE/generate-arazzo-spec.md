## Workflow Descriptions (Optional)
<!--
If you would like to request specific workflows, please add them as bullet points below under this section. Each bullet should describe a workflow you want generated from the OpenAPI specification. For example:

### Workflow Descriptions
- Create a new user and assign them a role
- Authenticate a user and fetch their profile
- Submit an order and retrieve order status

Note:
If workflows requested the generator will attempt to only create the requested workflows.
If no workflows are specified, the generator will attempt to discover workflows automatically.
The system will not generate single step/operation workflows even if requested
